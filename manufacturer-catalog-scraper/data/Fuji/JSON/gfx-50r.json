It combines outstanding resolution of 51.4 megapixels with exceptional tones, advanced color reproduction and high-performance lenses.","The focal plane shutter has been newly developed specifically for our mirrorless camera. While achieving a maximum shutter speed of 1/4000 sec. (1/16000 sec. when using electronic shutter), a flash synchronization speed of 1/125 sec. or less, and high performance and durability with a shutter endurance supporting up to 150,000 shots*1, the camera also achieves low vibration and a quiet shutter noise.","The GFX 50R is equipped with the 0.77x 3.69M-dot organic EL electronic viewfinder (EVF). This allows accurate focusing despite the large size of the medium format sensor, which has a shallower depth of field than that of a 35mm full frame sensor when shooting at the same angle of view.","This is the first model in the GFX system to support the BluetoothÂ® low energy technology. Captured images can be transferred easily and quickly to smartphones and tablet devices paired with the camera via the FUJIFILM Camera Remote app.","*1 According to Fujifilm internal testing.","Read more about our products in these downloadable PDF format brochures","The latest development roadmap for interchangeable lenses for the GFX Series"],"brochure":["https://dl.fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/gfx-50s/pdf/gfx_catalogue_01.pdf"]}
