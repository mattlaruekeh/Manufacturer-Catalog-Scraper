Additionally, automated functions will allow the camera to be set to recognize and track the subject within the frame.","Achieve focus in dimly lit enviroments up to -2.0EV and get great image quality with low noise because of the advanced image processing provided by the camera’s copper wire processor.","X-T200 is equipped with a vari-angle 3.5-inch/ 16:9 Aspect Ratio widescreen LCD touch-screen that can be opened and closed between 0 to 180 degrees and rotated between -90 to +180 degrees. It also provides an intuitive and responsive control over the camera’s features and functionality and can be used to adjust a variety of settings, like brightness, background blur, Film Simulation effects, and image aspect ratios.","Fujifilm’s legacy in color science has given it legendary status among image-makers across the world. During its 85 year history, it has been responsible for some of the most iconic photographic films in history and this exceptional knowledge has been poured into the 11 digital Film Simulation modes installed into X-T200. Images made with these film simulations carry the look and feel of the actual films that inspired them, which are a great building block to sparking creative imaging making.","PRO Neg.Hi","MONOCHROME","ASTIA/SOFT","CLASSIC CHROME","PRO Neg.Hi","MONOCHROME","ASTIA/SOFT","CLASSIC CHROME","PRO Neg.Hi","MONOCHROME","Emphasize light sources, boost contrast, add retro effects, or try the new Clarity filter to add an individual creative expression to any image.","MINIATURE","PARTIAL COLOR(YELLOW)","NEW CLARITY FILTER (+2)","TOY CAMERA","POP COLOR","HDR ART","MINIATURE","PARTIAL COLOR(YELLOW)","NEW CLARITY FILTER (+2)","TOY CAMERA","POP COLOR","HDR ART","MINIATURE","PARTIAL COLOR(YELLOW)","X-T200 generates 4K (3840×2150) video by recording 6K video with no crop (6032×3392) and downsampling it,\nwhich results in incredible image quality with very low noise.
